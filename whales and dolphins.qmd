This dataset compiles recorded births for Cetacean species and associated information including their birth year, sex, location, mother, father, status, etc. This plot shows the total births per year grouped by species to highlight long-term trends in population changes.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#| fig-alt: "Stacked bar chart showing the number of cetacean births per year from 2000 to 2020. Each color represents a different species, illustrating differences in birth counts across species over time."

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(viridis)  # for better contrasting colors

# Load data

  count(birthYear, species)

```

This stacked bar chart shows the number of cetacean births each year from 2000 to 2020, with each species represented by a different color. Some species have consistently higher birth counts, while others fluctuate more from year to year. For example, there are very many births per year in the Bottlenose species, and very few and inconsistent birth rates in the Atlantic Spotted species.The chart highlights species-level differences in reproduction and provides insight into population trends. These birth trends can inform conservation strategies and help researchers understand patterns in cetacean births over time.

The Cetacean dataset I worked with comes from the TidyTuesday database.

The original data set was made by Amber Thomas in her article for *The Pudding*.
