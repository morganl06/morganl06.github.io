This dataset compiles all Cetacean species and their birth information: their birth year, sex, location, mother, father, status, etc. This plot shows the total births per year by species.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

allCetaceanData <- read_csv("allCetaceanData.csv")

allCetaceanData |>
  filter(!is.na(birthYear), birthYear >= 2000, birthYear <= 2020) |>
  count(birthYear, species) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = birthYear, y = n, fill = species)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Number of Births",
    title = "Cetacean Births by Species (2000â€“2020)"
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "turbo") +   # better contrasting colors
  theme_minimal()
```

The Cetacean dataset I worked with comes from the TidyTuesday database.

The original data set was made by Tom Mock.
