Following the same theme as previously, we can see it follows the audience demand, and historical context. For example, we can see an increase from 5% to 25% of titles that are international TV shows, which emphasizes a broadening target audience.\nOver time, Netflix has shifted to an increasing number of TV shows comparing to movies. This is to address increase in demand, and cultural shift towards TV shows. We also notice less of an emphasis on movies with variations of Love and War, highly associated with a specific time period (mainly, the Second World War), which makes sense when looking at the historical context. In addition, there has been a shift in genre, to reach more people. There are more international TV shows released in recent years, and fewer action movies. This shows that Netflix shows are shifting in multiple ways to address increasing public demand, and societal changes.\nOne thing to be mindful of, is that the number of samples is limited from the 1940s to the 1990s, which explains why the values we see are so extreme, but don’t exactly reflect reality.\nThe dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.\n[link] https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2021/2021-04-20/readme.md"

We are exploring the specific average rate of mortality from diabetes in the United States and in France across all years.\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2018/2018-04-16\nThe original data comes from an article entitled Causes of death and published in the Our World in Data magazine by Saloni Dattani, Fiona Spooner, Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser at the following link:\nDattani, S., Spooner, F., Ritchie, H., & Roser, M. (2023). Causes of Death. Our World in Data. https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death\nIn this simulation study, we will explore whether France and the United States have the same average diabetes mortality rate. We will first calculate the observed difference in mean diabetes mortality between the two countries across all available years (1990-2016). To test whether the difference we observe could have been a result of random distribution, we will run a permutation test shuffling the diabetes mortality percentage rates countries 1000 times, to create a null distribution.\nMy research question is the following: do the United States and France have different mortality rates for diabetes on average from 1990 to 2006?\nThe null hypothesis (Ho) is that France and the US have the same average mortality rates for diabetes from 1990-2016.\nThe alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that France and the US have different average mortality rates for diabetes from 1990-2016.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmortality_filtered &lt;- global_mortality |&gt;\n  filter(country %in% c(\"France\", \"United States\")) |&gt;\n  select(country, year, `Diabetes (%)`)\n\n\nmortality_filtered &lt;- mortality_filtered |&gt;\n  rename(diabetes_pct = `Diabetes (%)`)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nmortality_avg &lt;- mortality_filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_diabetes = mean(`diabetes_pct`))\n\nmortality_avg\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  country       avg_diabetes\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 France                4.72\n2 United States         6.49\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mortality_avg, aes(x = country, y = avg_diabetes, fill = country)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Diabetes Mortality (%) Across All Years\",\n       x = \"Country\",\n       y = \"Average Diabetes Mortality (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe a difference in average mortality rate between the two countries, so now we are going to test if this is a result of the random distribution model, by establishing a null distribution. Instead of comparing only the two countries’ averages, we will repeatedly shuffle the yearly diabetes mortality percentages between the two countries, recompute the average mortality for each country, and record the difference. By repeating this process 1000 times, we can see how large the difference would be between the two countries if we were following the random chance model.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nobs_diff &lt;- diff(mortality_avg$avg_diabetes)\nobs_diff\n\n\n[1] 1.773729\n\n\nCode\nperm_data &lt;- function(rep, data) {\n  data |&gt;\n    select(country, `diabetes_pct`) |&gt;\n    mutate(diabetes_perm = sample(`diabetes_pct`, replace = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    group_by(country) |&gt;\n    summarize(\n      perm_ave = mean(diabetes_perm)\n    ) |&gt;\n    summarize(\n      perm_diff = diff(perm_ave),\n      rep = rep\n    )\n}\n\nset.seed(47)\nperm_stats &lt;- map(1:1000, perm_data, data = mortality_filtered) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(perm_stats, aes(x = perm_diff)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = \"pink\", color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = obs_diff), color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1.2) +\n  labs(title = \"Null Distribution of Difference in Diabetes Mortality (%)\",\n       subtitle = \"France vs United States (All Years)\",\n       x = \"Difference in Mean Mortality (France - U.S.)\",\n       y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np-value = 0 (&lt; 0.05) so this is strong evidence to reject our null hypothesis.\nWe can reject the hypothesis that the mortality rates are the same for diabetes across all years (1990-2016).\nThere is strong evidence that the alternative hypothesis stating that France and the US have different average mortality rates for diabetes from 1990-2016 is true."
