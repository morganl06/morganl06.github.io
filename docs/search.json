Following the same theme as previously, we can see it follows the audience demand, and historical context. For example, we can see an increase from 5% to 25% of titles that are international TV shows, which emphasizes a broadening target audience.\nOver time, Netflix has shifted to an increasing number of TV shows comparing to movies. This is to address increase in demand, and cultural shift towards TV shows. We also notice less of an emphasis on movies with variations of Love and War, highly associated with a specific time period (mainly, the Second World War), which makes sense when looking at the historical context. In addition, there has been a shift in genre, to reach more people. There are more international TV shows released in recent years, and fewer action movies. This shows that Netflix shows are shifting in multiple ways to address increasing public demand, and societal changes.\nOne thing to be mindful of, is that the number of samples is limited from the 1940s to the 1990s, which explains why the values we see are so extreme, but don’t exactly reflect reality.\nThe dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.\n[link] https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2021/2021-04-20/readme.md"
